# S4_FinalSprint_AVL-BST_Tree

- Part of the purpose of this project was to take the original code (javascript) done in semester 3 and refactor it in java
- The focus is on Binary Search Tree and an AVL Tree classes

- My CLI takes an input of numbers, and returns them as a JSON representation of a binary search tree and a balanced AVL tree in the IDE terminal

Notes:
- No DB was used (required), stored inputs and json outputs using a write to file module  
-	Units Tests were done on the BST, AVL, Node and jsonFIle java files
